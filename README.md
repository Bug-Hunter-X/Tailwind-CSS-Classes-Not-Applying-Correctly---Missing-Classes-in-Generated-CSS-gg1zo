# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly due to problems with CSS file organization and `@apply` directives. The `bug.html` file shows the initial code that resulted in the problem, while `bugSolution.html` presents the solution.

The problem stemmed from incorrect usage and organization causing missing generated CSS rules.  The solution involves refactoring the CSS structure and handling of `@apply` to ensure Tailwind properly processes the classes.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` and `bugSolution.html` in your browser to observe the issue and solution.
