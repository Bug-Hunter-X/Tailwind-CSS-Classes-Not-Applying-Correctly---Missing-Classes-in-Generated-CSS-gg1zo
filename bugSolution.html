The issue was resolved by restructuring the CSS and properly using the `@apply` directive.  The `@apply` directive should be used within a properly structured Tailwind class definition, not in arbitrary CSS.

Here's how the corrected code looks: 

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <div class="flex flex-col">
    <div class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">This is now correctly styled!</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

To use `@apply`, follow best practices from Tailwind's documentation.  The `@apply` directive should be within a Tailwind class definition, not in arbitrary CSS.  This ensures proper processing by the Tailwind CSS engine.
